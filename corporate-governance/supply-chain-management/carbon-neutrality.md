# Carbon Neutrality

## We are committed to being carbon neutral by 2035. Whilst we prepare, we are using 100% renewable energy and actively reducing our supply chain's footprint.

### 100% renewable energy.

Our initiatives prioritise sustainability, utilising 100% renewable energy across our datacentres to power operations. This reflects our commitment to reducing environmental impact and aligning with global sustainability efforts. By adopting renewable energy, we aim to lower carbon emissions, setting industry standards for ESG practices within workstation delivery. In addition, select office locations are powered by renewable energy.

### Reduction of single use materials.

Computle engineers and manufacturers its blade workstations in-house, enabling us to select each component that is used. To support recycling, we opt for materials that are readily recyclable, such as metal, and remove any plastics, such as front bezels. As a result, we estimate that at least 80% of each workstation can be recycled via conventional recycling programmes, and the remainder - components such as the printed circuit boards - recyclable via specialist offerings.

### Localised production.

Instead of delivering fully assembled workstations to our data centres, we prefer to use local inventory whenever possible and ship only the shells. This approach results in a savings of approximately 40kg in shipping weight per rack, thereby decreasing the carbon footprint.
