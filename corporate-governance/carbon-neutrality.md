# Carbon Neutrality

## We are dedicated to achieving carbon neutrality by 2035. While on this journey, we have transitioned key sites to 100% renewable energy and are actively working to minimize the carbon footprint of our supply chain.

***

## 100% Renewable Energy

Wherever feasible, we operate on 100% renewable energy. This commitment underscores our efforts to reduce environmental impact and aligns with global sustainability initiatives. By embracing renewable energy, we aim to significantly lower carbon emissions and set industry benchmarks for ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) practices within workstation delivery. Additionally, select office locations and mixed-energy sites are transitioning to renewable sources, reflecting our continuous drive towards sustainable operations.

## Use of Biodiesel for Backup Generators

To further reduce our environmental footprint, our facility partners are introducing biodiesel as a sustainable fuel alternative for our backup generators, where possible. Biodiesel offers a renewable solution that significantly lowers emissions compared to traditional diesel, helping us align with our carbon-neutral goals. By integrating biodiesel into our operations, we continue to uphold our commitment to sustainability even in areas reliant on backup power.

## Reduction of Single-Use Materials

At Computle, we engineer and manufacture our blade workstations in-house, giving us complete control over component selection. To enhance recyclability, we prioritize materials such as metals while eliminating unnecessary plastics, like front bezels. As a result, approximately 80% of each workstation is recyclable through conventional programs, with the remaining components—such as printed circuit boards—recycled via specialized facilities.

## Localised Production

Rather than shipping fully assembled workstations to our data centres, we leverage local inventory wherever possible and only transport essential components. This approach reduces shipping weight by approximately 40 kg per rack, significantly lowering our transportation-related carbon footprint.

## Energy Status Across Locations

Our commitment to renewable energy is reflected in the energy sources used across our sites. As part of our transition to full sustainability, several key sites are already powered by 100% renewable energy, while others are currently operating on mixed energy sources as they progress towards full renewable energy integration. The table below provides an overview of the energy status at our global locations:

| **Site** | **Status**                       |
| -------- | -------------------------------- |
| UK-A     | Powered by 100% renewable energy |
| UK-B     | Powered by 100% renewable energy |
| SGP-A    | Powered by 100% renewable energy |
| SGP-B    | Powered by 100% renewable energy |
| NY-A     | Mixed energy sources             |
| NY-B     | Mixed energy sources             |
| LA-A     | Mixed energy sources             |
| LA-B     | Mixed energy sources             |
| HK-A     | Mixed energy sources             |
| HK-B     | Mixed energy sources             |
| SYD-A    | Mixed energy sources             |
| SYD-B    | Mixed energy sources             |
| PL-A     | Mixed energy sources             |
| PL-B     | Mixed energy sources             |
| DXB-A    | Mixed energy sources             |
| DXB-B    | Mixed energy sources             |

As we transition our mixed-energy sites to renewable energy sources, we continue to take meaningful steps towards achieving carbon neutrality by 2035.
