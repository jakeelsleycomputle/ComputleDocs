# Our Approach to Engineering

## Other companies resell someone else's kit. We design our own patentable hardware and pass on savings of up to 80%.

***

A typical VDI provider will purchase off-the-shelf servers or workstations, cram a bunch of virtual machines onto them, and place them in a data centre.\
\
Whilst this is fine for some use cases, when you start to scale the service or use more demanding application, the platform's users start to face _significant_ barriers and bottlenecks.\


* You'll experience CPU, GPU and disk contention.
* Your costs will be significantly more than a regular computer or workstation.
* And you will inefficiently utilise data centre space, resulting in poor-cost optimisations and a difficultly adding more nodes efficiently.

**Computle took a different approach from day one.**\


**‍**At the outset of Computle's foundation, Jake engineered his own hardware, placing an emphasis on dedicated, single-user servers/workstations.\
\
We are now on _revision four_ of our hardware, and currently operate Computle from a series of blade workstations, each equipped with:‍

* A dedicated CPU;
* A dedidicated GPU;
* And a dedicated NVMe and RAM modules.

Because of this, each Computle seat delivers unparalleled performance compared to VDIs, with each seat/user having dedicated access to an entire blade workstation.\
\
**What's more, each Computle blade costs around half the price of off-the-shelf hardware, enabling us to pass on significant cost savings to our customers.**
