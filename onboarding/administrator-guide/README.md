# Administrator Guide

To access Computle, you require both a Computle Gateway account, and a Computle Machine.

Computle Gateway acts as a network tunnel enabling you to access your tenant resources. Once you have established a connection, you can then access your Computle Machines.&#x20;

**To get started, choose your desired pathway:**

* If you have not already onboarded a user into Computle Gateway for SMEs, follow [these ](computle-gateway-for-smes.md)instructions.&#x20;
* If you have enrolled a user into Computle Gateway, create a machine [here](machine-portal.md).&#x20;
