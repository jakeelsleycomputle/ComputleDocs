# Administrator Guide

To access Computle, you require both a Computle Gateway account, and a Computle Machine.

Computle Gateway acts as a network tunnel enabling you to access your tenant resources. Once you have established a connection, you can then access your Computle Machines.&#x20;

**To get started, choose your desired pathway:**

* If you have not already onboarded a user into Computle Gateway, follow [these ](../administration/user-onboarding/administrator/gateway-deployment.md)instructions.&#x20;
* If you have enrolled a user into Computle Gateway, create a machine [here](../administration/user-onboarding/administrator/machine-deployment.md).&#x20;
