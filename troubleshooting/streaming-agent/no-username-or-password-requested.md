# No Username or Password Requested

If you get an error where it does not ask for the username or password, please install the latest [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc\_redist.x64.exe).

Alternatively, you can use the web client, but note that performance will be reduced.
