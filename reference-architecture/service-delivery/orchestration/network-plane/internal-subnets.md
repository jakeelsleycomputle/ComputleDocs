# Internal Subnets

## CGNAT Ranges

We utilise Carrier-Grade Network Address Translation (CGNAT) for internal IP ranges, covering Computle Machines, and Computle Gateway devices. All devices operate within the 100.X.X.X/10) range. CGNAT ensures that our internal network addresses remain distinct from external or public IP addresses allowing customers to integrate Computle with existing infrastructure without unexpected routing impacts.
