# Hardware Keys

Computle leverages phishing-resistant FIDO2 keys with WebAuthn as a crucial component of our Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) strategy. By incorporating these hardware-based security keys into our authentication process, we provide an additional layer of security beyond passwords. When users access our systems or services, they are required to use their FIDO2 key, combined with a password and a trusted device. This hardware-based MFA adds a robust security layer, effectively reducing the risk of phishing attacks.
