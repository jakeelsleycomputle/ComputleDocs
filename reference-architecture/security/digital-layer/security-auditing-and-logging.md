# Security Auditing and Logging

## Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

Computle's SIEM solution aggregates data from various sources, including network devices, servers, applications, and security tools, to provide a holistic view of our estate. By continuously monitoring this data, we can quickly detect and respond to security events and incidents, such as suspicious network traffic, unauthorized access attempts, or malware outbreaks and provide automatic remediation such as device quarantine.

## Security Auditing and Logging

Security auditing and logging are essential components of Computle's security approach, enabling us to detect and respond to security incidents, maintain compliance, and continuously enhance our security posture. These practices are crucial in our commitment to protecting our clients' data and assets from emerging cybersecurity threats.
