# Host Isolation

Each physical host in our infrastructure is dedicated exclusively to running a single Computle machine instance for a customer. This approach guarantees that a customer's workload operates in complete isolation, with exclusive access to the underlying hardware resources. By dedicating each host to one client, we eliminate the risk of data co-mingling and resource contention. This strict isolation enhances data security and privacy, minimizing the potential impact of security incidents on neighboring instances.&#x20;
