# Data Centres

Computle places paramount importance on physical security to ensure the safeguarding of sensitive data within its data centers and critical infrastructure. To achieve this, we have implemented stringent measures to control and monitor access to our facilities. Our data centers are equipped with multi-layered security systems, including biometric authentication, access card systems, and video surveillance.

Only authorized personnel with the appropriate credentials are granted entry to restricted areas, and all access events are closely monitored and logged. Furthermore, our server rooms are designed with reinforced access points, environmental controls, and fire suppression systems to mitigate potential physical threats.&#x20;
