# Security

## Data Centres

Computle places paramount importance on physical security to ensure the safeguarding of sensitive data within its data centers and critical infrastructure. To achieve this, we have implemented stringent measures to control and monitor access to our facilities. Our data centers are equipped with multi-layered security systems, including biometric authentication, access card systems, and video surveillance.

Only authorized personnel with the appropriate credentials are granted entry to restricted areas, and all access events are closely monitored and logged. Furthermore, our server rooms are designed with reinforced access points, environmental controls, and fire suppression systems to mitigate potential physical threats.&#x20;

## Host Isolation

Each physical host in our infrastructure is dedicated exclusively to running a single Computle machine instance for a customer. This approach guarantees that a customer's workload operates in complete isolation, with exclusive access to the underlying hardware resources. By dedicating each host to one client, we eliminate the risk of data co-mingling and resource contention. This strict isolation enhances data security and privacy, minimizing the potential impact of security incidents on neighboring instances.&#x20;

## Site Isolation

Computle implements stringent network segmentation and access controls to ensure that data and resources within one site remain completely separate from those in other sites. This approach reduces the attack surface and prevents potential lateral movement for cyber attackers
