# Vulnerability Disclosure Programme

Our VDP is designed to facilitate a responsible and collaborative approach to cybersecurity, ensuring that any reported vulnerabilities are acknowledged, thoroughly investigated, and addressed in a timely and responsible manner. Your assistance in identifying and reporting potential security risks is invaluable in helping us maintain the integrity and security of our systems and data, and we greatly appreciate your commitment to responsible disclosure.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please contact us directly at **GetHelp@Computle.com**. Please note that we will not respond to reports of minor or non-impactful issues that do not pose a meaningful risk to our systems or data. We will also not respond to vulnerability reports that directly relate to a customer's use of Computle or its services.&#x20;
